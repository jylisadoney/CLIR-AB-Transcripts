question 1,What’s your perspective on the Crabtree collection and one’s like it? Is it appropriative of Native cultures?
question 2,Do you think folks digitizing digital collections who are not anthropologists should take up this type of contextualizing work? If so, how can we be successful without causing further harm?
question 3,What makes a digital effort like this a good partner to Native nations and people? What can the academy, and land grant schools, do to be better partners and be more accountable to Native stakeholders?
question 4,From your perspective, what should people know about flintknapping to understand the art and practice in a way that doesn’t center this one, white, non-native person?
question 5,One of the topics we’ve discussed as part of this grant project is the relationship between experimental archaeology, amateur archaeology, and cultural as well as knowledge appropriation. Can you talk a bit about what you see as the relationship between these concepts?
question 6,As we’ve discussed, the Crabtree collection includes objects Crabtree created as well as objects created by Native and Indigenous people that he or those who knew him looted. What options are there for discovering the geological provenance of the Native belongings, especially when any residues have not been preserved?
question 7,What do you wish more people understood about experimental archeology and how it intersects with cultural preservation, as well as cultural appropriation?
